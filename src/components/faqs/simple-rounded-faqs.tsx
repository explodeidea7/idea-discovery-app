    question: "How is this different from generic business idea generators?",
    answer:

    question: "What if I don't like the business idea you recommend?",
    answer:
      "We only present ideas with high confidence scores based on thorough analysis of your profile and market conditions. However, if you're not satisfied with your recommendation, we offer a 100% money-back guarantee. Our goal is to provide you with an idea you're genuinely excited to pursue.",

    question: "How long does the analysis take?",
    answer:
      "The typical analysis takes 15-30 minutes to complete. During this time, our AI processes your responses, analyzes market data, validates opportunities, and generates your comprehensive business idea report. You'll see real-time progress updates throughout the process.",
